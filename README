hw10 The DINOSHELL
===========================
This is the third version. 
In this version, we have completed everything.

We also have extra things: 1) grouping arguments with double and single quotes, 2) taking care 
of commands where before and after > or <, there are no spaces(unless the space is necessary. 
It acts exactly the same as bash on this.)
