hw10 The DINOSHELL
===========================
This is the first version. We will update to a complete version later.
In this version, we have completed everything except piping and background running process.

We also have extra things: 1) grouping arguments with double and single quotes, 2) taking care 
of commands where before and after > or <, there are no spaces(unless the space is necessary. 
It acts exactly the same as bash on this.)

We will release a better dinoshell very soon.
